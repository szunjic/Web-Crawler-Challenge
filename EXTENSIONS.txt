Once your solution is completed please add an EXTENSIONS.txt file to your solution
that notes how your application could be extended to handle the following:
 - Domains beyond Amazon.com
 - Products beyond just simply books.


My solution is not complete. 
I struggled to find the specific data points on Amazon (those beyond book title and url).
If I had more time and experience with building web crawlers, I think I would have certainly built a fully functioning web crawler.

That being said, I would improve my application by breaking it up into smaller parts.
I'd include smaller, more specific functions, that could take in different URLs and grab whatever data is needed.

I would separate the code that defines the crawler from the code that uses the crawler (instead of just writing one large script like I did with this challenge).

Instead of putting everything in a single script, I'd create something like crawl-books.js that exports a crawl function and isolates its logic and dependencies, something like: 

// crawl-books.js

var request = require('request');
var cheerio = require('cheerio');
var URL = require('url-parse');

function crawlBooks(url, numberOfBooks) {
   
}

module.exports = crawl;

And then I would use it in something like app.js, like this:

// app.js

var crawl = require('./crawl.js);

crawl('https://www.amazon.com', 10, function(bookData) {
    // do what you want with the book data
});

And then call node app.js to run the program.



I would also improve my app by breaking up the code that defines the crawler into tiny little parts that have more helpful names. For instance:

// crawl-books.js

function handleBookData () {

}


function getBookData() {
 
}


function tryUrl(url) {
    request(listingPage, function(error, response, body) {
        if (error) {
             throw error;
         }
    }
}

function crawlBooks(url, numberOfBooks, callback) {
     tryUrl(url);
     getBookData(url + '/books', function() {
         callback();
     })
}

module.exports = crawlBooks;


Lastly, I have never used any other third party javascript scraping library other than Cheerio, so I would definitely want to learn about others and see how they compare Cheerio.
